#  MovieLens Movie Genre & Age Group Analysis – SAS Programming

##  Project Summary
This project explores movie rating behaviors using the MovieLens dataset. The aim was to analyze:
1. Whether movie genres influence user ratings
2. Whether user age groups have different preferred genres

The work was completed as part of a university group project, but **all SAS programming, data processing, and analysis was completed by me individually.**

##  Datasets Used
- `movies.dat`: Movie titles & genres
- `ratings.dat`: User ratings (1–5 scale)
- `users.dat`: User age, gender, occupation, zip

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **SAS Studio Programming**
- Data ingestion using `infile`, `dlm`, and `input`
- Data cleaning using `where`, `drop`, `length`, `set`, and conditional filtering
- Dataset merging via `proc sort`, `merge`, and `data` steps
- Validation with `proc freq`, `proc sort`, and `proc contents`
- Basic plotting (bar and pie charts) and frequency reporting
- Research question framing and result interpretation

---

##  Key Findings
- **Comedy and Drama** genres consistently received the most high ratings across all age groups
- **Fantasy and Film-Noir** genres had the fewest above-average ratings
- **Age group 25–34** was the most active user group
- Genre preferences evolve with age: younger users prefer Comedy, while older users lean toward Drama
